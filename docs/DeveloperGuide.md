## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Parser Component
The component will return the correct command based on what the user inputs into the application.

#### How is the feature implemented?

The Parser component parses the command of the user input and breaks the user input into different parts based on the flags.
This component also ensures to validate that user input is correct.

The Parser component handles the following methods:
* Add event
* Add module
* List event list
* Delete event
* Edit event
* Find date of week
* Format checker
* Revise information using index
* Revise information using name

The UML diagram below illustrates the flow of how the application adds events:

The UML diagram below illustrates the flow of how the application adds modules:
![Add Event Class Diagram](UML/Images/addModules.png)

#### Why is the feature implemented this way?

This component should be able to guide the user to inputting the correct format of the command to do data validation.
It should be able to perform basic data validation checks to ensure that the user does not enter any invalid commands.
This makes life easier to developers in the future if they wish to add new features that requires users to use new commands.

### Storage Component
API: `Storage.java`

The storage component reads and writes user data from a local save in the form of a `.json` file.
The Storage component:
* Serializes and deserializes user data into a `.json` file format through the use of the Gson library
* Loads data from `NusMods.json` into a HashMap for use by other classes.
* Inherits from both `EventListStorage` and `NusModuleLoader`, and can be treated as either one.
* Saves and loads information from the local hard disk
* Depends on some classes (the `storage` component saves and retrieves objects)

The class diagram below illustrates the structure of the storage package

![Storage Class Diagram](UML/Images/StorageClass.png)

#### How the feature is implemented:

##### Load Events

![Load Events Sequence Diagram](UML/Images/loadEvents.png)

When the application starts up, the storage loadEvents() function will be called to load contents in the save file. 

##### Load Modules
![Load Modules Sequence Diagram](UML/Images/LoadModules.png)

When any component requires reading the NUS module files, the loadModules() is called.

##### Save Events

![Save To File Sequence Diagram](UML/Images/SaveToFile.png)

Similarly, the state of the user's event list is saved when the user exits the application by calling saveToFile().

#### Justification for using gson
The Gson library was chosen as it allowed for flexible adaptation of its TypeAdapter class, allowing for custom 
serialization and deserialization of data to be saved. 

### EventList component

API: `EventList.java`

this component maintains a list of Schedule instance. It receives commands from Parser.java and adds/deletes/edits tasks and their information in the list according to the commands.

#### How is the feature implemented:

the main functions are

> - add new task (accepts event without starting time/ending time/ending date).
> - delete a single tasks / delete all tasks.
> - edit the time information of task (starting time/ending time/ending date can be omitted).
> - search for a event by index / description.
> - get all the detail of a event in the list in String form.

The class diagram below illustrates the structure of the EventList component.

And below is a sequential diagram showing a event being added, revised, checked for information and finally deleted.

#### Why implemented in this way:

It is necessary to have a list which contains all the current event/class so that we can show/ batch process events more efficiently. Moreover, this component serves intermediary functions and avoids other classes access deep into the functionality of classes (Event, Schedule e.t.c) inside the ArrayList, thus reduces the coupling of the code base. Additionally, this component also converted all the String parameters parsed by Parser into various Types that required by other classes that the EventList contains, further reducing the coupling.
